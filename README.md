Project Overview:

As a student aiming to enhance my skills in Android development using Java, I have undertaken this project to build a mobile game application titled "Catch Jerry." This project is designed to improve my proficiency in Android Java by implementing key features such as:

Displaying and managing images dynamically.
Handling user interactions and game logic.
Developing a responsive and engaging user interface.
Through this project, I am focusing on practical application of Android Java concepts, including UI design, event handling, and randomization techniques. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of Android app development.
